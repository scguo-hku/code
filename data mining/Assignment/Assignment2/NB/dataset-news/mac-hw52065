    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially
if you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do
is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my
office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor's tube.

>Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.

    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office
