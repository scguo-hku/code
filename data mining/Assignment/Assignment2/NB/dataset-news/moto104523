|Driving While Intoxicated.

  Actually, I beleive "DWI" normally means "Driving While Impaired" rather
than "Intoxicated", at least it does in the states I've lived in...

  One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor - drugs,
not enough sleep, being a total moron :-), all can impair someone etc...  I'm
surprised this got her off the hook...  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana *is* confined
to liquor?
