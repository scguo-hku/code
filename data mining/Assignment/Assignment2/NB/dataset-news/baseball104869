That'll teach me not to qualify my statements...

OK, something to shoot for.  The Royals will score 531 runs or less
this season (although they just decided to get McRae out of the
leadoff spot :-( )

Of course, Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the
Royals even manage to outscore another AL team.
