Can somebody tell me what all the letter spesifications on motorcycle models 
really mean. 
Example: What means the C, the B and the R in Honda CBR. - Or the V, S, G, L 
and P in Suzuki VS750GLP

I wanna distribute this in our club magazine. I want lists of all types, but 
I already knows about Harley.

Thanks in advance!
