|Course, the only people who seem to be acting smug now probably have chain
|final drive (which, as we all know, is less efficient and has higher
|maintenance) and probably didn't know the answer at the start of the thread.

  When did *you* go out and change the laws of physics? :-)  According to some
numbers I used to see bandied around, shaft drive is on the order of 95-97%
efficient, while chain drive is closer to 99%...   Seems to me that this makes
*chain* drive more efficient, hmmmmm???

  And granted, shaft has a lot less maintenance, which is fine, if you don't
mind less performance... :-) :-)
