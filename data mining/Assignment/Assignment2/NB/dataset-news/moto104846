Don't forget little girls!  My not-quite-2 year old daughter now
excitedly points and says "motorcycle" every time she sees one go
past.  I've done my work.  (Of course, it helps that one of her
books shows Sir Topham Hatt in a chaffeured side car rig...)

Can you think of a better way to convince the kid that "someday, I'll
ride one of those things"?

No, it's a genetic thing with little humans...

Just don't let them touch hot pipes.
