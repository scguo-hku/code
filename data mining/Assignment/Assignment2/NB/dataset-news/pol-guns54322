The Koreshians rubbed themselves out.  Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene, so I'm not particularly
concerned.  (Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also?)

Be thankful that the BATF standoff at least got some of the kids out before
the cult committed mass suicide.

Followups out of soc.culture.jewish.
