I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard that
failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed
or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key.  After absolutely
no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support.  They tried it out
on their Centris 610 and had the same problem.  They immediately offered
to get a new keyboard, try it on their Centris and ship it to me
overnight if it worked.  I could send them my keyboard back after I
got the one that worked.  This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave.
