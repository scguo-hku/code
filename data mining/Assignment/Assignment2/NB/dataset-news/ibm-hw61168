I have a Nanao 17" (F560?)  on my IPX. I prefer it to my Sun 16"
trinitron at work with all those vertical jitters and the two
horizontal shadowmask thingies.

I got it from one of the folks advertising in Computer Shopper et al
for $1050 plus about $40 shipping. 

I bought a cable which goes from the Sun's 13W3 connector to the
monitors 4xRGBS for about $50 from a Macintosh mailorder shop (Relax
Technologies).
